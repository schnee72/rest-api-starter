# rest-api-starter
A starting point for a REST API using Nodejs, Express, ES6 and Mongoose.

This is heavily based on the yeoman [generator-api](https://github.com/ndelvalle/generator-api) and the [RESTful Web Services with Node.js and Express](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/node-js-express-rest-web-services) course on Pluralsight.

In process of learning, this is how I ended up setting things up for a basic RESTful API.

To run this for dev:
```
npm run dev
```
